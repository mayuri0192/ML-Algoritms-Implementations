Implement your own neural network for regression purpose in Python
using mean squared error as the cost function.

The neural network has two input units (not counting the bias unit), one hidden layer
with two units (not counting the bias unit), and two output units. Assume that there
is only one sample being

x =[0:05
    0:1]

y =[ 0:01
     0:99]

theta(1) and theta(2) are initialized to be uniformly distributed random numbers between
0.0 and 1.0.
Plotted the total cost vs the iterations as well as every parameter  vs the iterations.
